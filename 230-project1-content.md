# Ranger Danger

## High Concept 

A walk in the park has never been so scary. Watch out for bears and raccoons!

## Genre 

Wave Survival Shooter

## Platform

Desktop only

## Story

### Theme

You are a park ranger for a local forest, and you are getting swamped with phone calls regarding many occurances in the forest. Go to three different areas of the forest and dispel the problems. Be sure to get back home in time to help your wife make dinner or you will be in ranger danger!

### Player Motivation

Getting the most points in the shortest amount of time is the main goal of the game. Thematically, the more problems you solve (scaring off bears or rescuing cats from trees), the more points you get. And the faster that you get home, the happier your wife will be! Beating other playerâ€™s high scores will also drive the player to keep playing.

## Esthetics

### Graphics style

The game will certainly have a cartoony 16-bit style. This will help to keep the game lighthearted, and fits the theme. 

### Sound

Some nature sounds would be featured, in an older 8-bit style. Some birds chirping and other sounds will help the atmosphere. It will also sound satisfying to solve problems, so small victory tunes will certainly be featured.

## Gameplay

### Control

The player will be able to control their character by using the WASD keys (W being up, D being right, S being down, and A being left). As of now, the park ranger will be equipped with some sleeping darts if he ever faces any immediate dangers. You will be able to press the spacebar to fire off a sleeping dart which will hopefully be enough to take down larger forest creatures. The user will also be able to press escape to pause the game. This will show his progress back home, and the score.

### Teaching the game

The game is fairly simple, as most of the combat will come to you. A brief instructions screen can be shown to the user at the start and additionally on the pause screen. The controls are fairly standard, and the game is repetitive so the player will not have to be constantly learning new things.

## Screenshots
